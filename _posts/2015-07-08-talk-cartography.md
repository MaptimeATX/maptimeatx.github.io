Let's get together to discuss some basics of cartography, especially with regards to web maps! If you have any knowledge on the subject, we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mind coming to share it with the group.

Depending on time, we might also have a chance to talk about projects or for general questions and answers about map technology.

Hope you can make it!
