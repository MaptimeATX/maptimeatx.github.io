In our first gathering of MaptimeATX, we'll go over the fundamentals of web mapping, including what they are and the basics for making your own. This will be very beginner friendly. 

Afterwards, we'll have time to socialize and for more advanced members to show off their maps during an informal lightning talk session.

Make sure to bring a laptop so you can code along with the presentation!
