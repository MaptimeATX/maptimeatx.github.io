Come get together with all your mapping friends and friends-to-be for Projects and Questions Night!

Rather than having a specific topic or agenda, this meetup will be a time for us to reconnect and for everyone to talk through and work on any mapping related questions they might have.

Also, this will be our first meeting at our new location. Hopefully this spot will give us some more stability for hosting regular meetups. Hope to see you there!
