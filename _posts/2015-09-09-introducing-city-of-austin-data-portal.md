The City of Austin data portal is like a portal to another world â€¦of data! This
presentation by longtime Open Austin participant Chris McConnell will introduce
the data portal and walk through tasks such as discovering data, manipulating
data, and mapping through the data portal's native interface, as well as
exporting data for use in other applications. Potential uses of city data for
research and public participation will also be discussed. Bring a notebook
computer to follow along with the demonstration.
