For February's Maptime, we're going to move away from our usual technology focus to learn about creating hand-drawn maps with local artist & architect [Ann Armstrong](http://ann-made.org). Super cool!

Ann is a collaborator of the Austin’s Atlas collective. Austin's Atlas is a cartography collective that loves exploring the city on foot and bike. They also enjoy rendering idiosyncratic experiences of place via hand drawn maps. During this Maptime Meetup, we’ll complete two quick mapping exercises, and then embark on a slightly longer/exploratory project. We’ll also have the Austin's Atlas cartography/urbanography library present for perusal.  More info about Austin’s Atlas and their current projects can be found at [austinsatlas.com](http://austinsatlas.com).

Hope you can make it!
