Let's get together to learn about OpenStreetMap! OSM is like Wikipedia for street maps -- It's built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.

We'll go over how we can use and contribute to OSM, and then have a mini mapping session!
