Our first GeoCoffee had a pretty decent turnout, so let's have another!

This will be a small, informal gathering over coffee and popovers at the Casa Brasil Popup Cafe at Foreign & Domestic on North Loop. Come meet other Austin area mappers, people interested in mapping, and people who might not have any idea what mapping is.

This GeoCoffee will be more on schedule with how I'd like to have events scheduled from here on: one GeoCoffee per month, one larger meetup per month, staggered by 2 weeks.

Bonus points if you have something quick to show the group!
