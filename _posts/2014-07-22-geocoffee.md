This will be a small, informal gathering over coffee and popovers at the Casa Brasil Popup Cafe at Foreign & Domestic on North Loop. We can discuss goals for MaptimeATX, answer basic mapping questions, and see if anyone else might be interested in helping with meetup organization and content development.

Come in when you can, leave when you'd like, don't worry about staying the full time. If you just want to drop in to say hi, please don't be afraid to do that.

Some of the other Maptime chapters have similar events (like GeoBreakfast in Portland), so I'd like to check out the interest in doing something similar here in Austin.
