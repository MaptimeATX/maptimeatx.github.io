title: Intro to Turf Recap
---

On 6/10/15 James gave an Intro to Turf.js presentation. The slides can be found at [maptimeatx.github.io/intro-to-turf](http://maptimeatx.github.io/intro-to-turf/). The presentation also includes a hands-on activity for groups to work on together. Turf.js is a relatively new JavaScript library for geospatial analysis. More information, including documentation and neat interactive examples, can be found at [turfjs.org](http://turfjs.org/).
