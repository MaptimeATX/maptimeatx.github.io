title: Intro to CartoDB Recap
---

Last night James gave a short talk on CartoDB ([maptime.io/cartodb-tutorial](maptime.io/cartodb-tutorial)), followed by a tutorial of making a map of world cities sized by population. Data for the world cities came from [Natural Eart](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/), a really great resource for public domain cartographic features. After the tutorial, Maptimers worked a few exercises, such as making a choropleth map of population in US counties, and an animated "torque" map of all the earthquakes in the last 30 days. The tutorial and exercise prompts can be found at [maptimeatx.github.io/cartodb-exercises/](http://maptimeatx.github.io/cartodb-exercises/).

We had a great group of folks come to the meetup, including several new members. We hope we see you all again at future Maptimes!

Thanks once again to [ObjectRocket](https://objectrocket.com/) for hosting and to [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com) for pizza!
