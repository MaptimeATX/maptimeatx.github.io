title: Inaugural Meetup Summary
---

Last night was MaptimeATX's first full-fledged [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeATX/events/193976172/) and it was a big success! We had a full house of approximately 30 people in [MakerSquare's](http://www.makersquare.com/) ancillary classroom on Brazos Street in Downtown Austin. Pizza and drinks from Hoboken Pies were graciously provided by [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com).

[James](http://twitter.com/hydrologee) gave a presentation on *Web Mapping Fundamentals*, which covered the basics pieces of moden web maps, such as tiles, web mapping libraries, and vectors. After the presentation was a brief coding exercise where attendees learned how to use [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) to make simple web maps of their own.

The presentation is available online at [http://maptimeatx.github.io/web-mapping-fundamentals/](http://maptimeatx.github.io/web-mapping-fundamentals/), and the source files for it are in MaptimeATX's GitHub account at [https://github.com/MaptimeATX](https://github.com/MaptimeATX).

Thanks to all who came out to our first meetup, and we look forward to seeing you all at the next one! Stay tuned for details!
