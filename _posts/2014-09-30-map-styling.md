At this meeting we'll be learning the basics of map styling using *CartoCSS* in the *TileMill* program.

Please bring a laptop so you can work along with the group. It will also be good if you can preinstall TileMill, which is free and open source, from here: [https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)

Our events have limited space so, to be fair to others, please RSVP yes only if you can make it. Thanks!
