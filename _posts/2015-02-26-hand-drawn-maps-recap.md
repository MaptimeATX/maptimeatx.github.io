title: Hand Drawn Maps Recap
---

On 2/25/15 we had a really cool meetup on *hand-drawn maps*. This session was led by local artist & architect [Ann Armstrong](http://ann-made.org), one of the collaborators of the [Austin's Atlas](http://austinsatlas.com) project. We had a total of 25 attendees, making this one of our largest sessions to date.

Ann guided the group through three different mapping prompts: mapping your daily commute, mapping your childhood home, and mapping Austin's downtown alleys. The third prompt was an especially cool exercise where the group broke up into small groups to explore and map nearby alleys. Alleyways are often forgotten and nameless areas, but they each can hold their own interesting secrets and characteristics. Here are scans of the maps we created: http://issuu.com/austinsatlas/docs/atlasissuumaptime
